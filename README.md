# Personal Financial Manager

This program tracks all your money interactions.

For example, if you buy a sandwich for 10 bucks, you withdraw 10 bucks from your account and record that it was for the sandwich.

## Features
- **Vaults**: Each user has vaults, which are used to organize money into categories like "Food," "Fun," "Savings," etc.
  
- **Main Operations**: The program supports 4 main operations:
  1. **Withdraw**: Used to take money from a vault.
  2. **Deposit**: Used to add money to a vault.
  3. **Transfer**: Used to move money between different vaults or to send money to another user's main vault.
  4. **Loan**: Used to transfer money to/from me or to/from another user (or a non-user, like a friend who doesnâ€™t use the app) and record that I owe them money or they owe me money.

### Detailed Transaction Tracking
- In the **Withdraw** and **Deposit** operations, a "reason" or "category" must be specified to track where the money went.

### How to Use
